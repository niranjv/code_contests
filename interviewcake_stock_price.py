#
# Description:
# Write an efficient function that takes a list of prices for a stock and returns the best profit that could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of the stock yesterday.
# 
# For example:

# stock_prices_yesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]
# get_max_profit(stock_prices_yesterday)
# # returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
# 
# REQUIREMENTS:
# - Stock price list index is time => stock prices are in ascending order of time
# - No "shorting" â€” you must buy before you sell. 
# - You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).


def get_max_profit(stock_prices):

    :type stock_prices: list of real numbers representing price of a stock at a given minute in USD

    Method:
    - Keep track of the lowest stock price so far (min_price)
    - Calculate profit (max_profit) between current price & min_price
    - Update max_profit and min_price in every iteration

    Complexity: 
    - Time: O(n) since we loop throughg the list only once
    - Space: O(1) since we only store min_price & max_profit
